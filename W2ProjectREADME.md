## **SetUp Instructions**
```
1. Create a website with input forms for the day,month & year
2. Using form operations enable the forms to receive input for the day,date & year.
3. Calculate the day of the week based on the formula Day of the week (d) = ( ( (CC/4) -2*CC-1) + ((5*YY/4) ) + ((26*(MM+1)/10)) + DD ) mod 7

 where;

 CC - is the century digits. For example 1989 has CC = 19

 YY - is the Year digits (1989 has YY = 89)

 MM -  is the Month

 DD - is the Day of the month 

 mod - is the modulus function ( % )

 4. Create an array for days of the week.
 5.Based on the day of the week as in step 3 evaluate the calculation in Step 4
 6. Here,we are ready to display the name.
 7.Create a switch statment for the names.
 8.Create an if statement for validation.
 9. Create a witch statement for days of the week.
